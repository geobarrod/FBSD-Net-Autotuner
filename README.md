# FreeBSD Network Autotuner

## Purpose
Dynamically adjusts the TCP stack, congestion control algorithm, buffers, and queues based on real-time network metrics such as latency, packet loss, jitter, throughput, kernel drops, and out-of-order segments.
It is designed to optimize FreeBSD networking performance in diverse and changing conditions.

---

## Usage
```sh
sudo fbsd-net-autotuner [-d] [-l]
```

## Options
- `-d` → Add date and time to the event log.
- `-l` → Log events to the file `/var/log/fbsd-net-autotuner.log`.

---

## Configuration Variables
You can override these defaults by exporting environment variables before running the script:

| Variable       | Default | Description                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TARGET_HOST`  | auto    | Host used for ping measurements. Selected dynamically from public resolvers (1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1, 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, 9.9.9.9) based on lowest RTT. |
| `IFACE`        | auto    | Network interface to monitor. Auto-detected from default route or falls back to the first interface.                                           |
| `PING_COUNT`   | 10      | Number of pings per round                                                                                                                      |
| `INTERVAL_SEC` | 60      | Interval between measurements (sec)                                                                                                            |

## Features
- Auto-selects the most responsive `TARGET_HOST` from a resilient list of public resolvers.  
- Detects NIC speed robustly (validates numeric values, defaults to 1000 Mbps).  
- Classifies network conditions into tiers: `very_slow`, `slow`, `medium`, `fast`, `very_fast`.  
- Dynamically selects TCP congestion control algorithm and stack:
  - Algorithms: `cubic`, `chd`, `htcp`, `dctcp`, `cdg`, `vegas`
  - Stacks: `freebsd`, `bbr`, `rack`
- Adjusts:
  - Buffer sizes (recv/send, `maxsockbuf`)
  - ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)
  - Keepalive
  - Delayed ACK (tier-based with jitter override)
  - SACK (Selective ACK)
  - Initial congestion window (`initcwnd_segments`)
  - TSO (toggle based on kernel drops)
  - ABC (`net.inet.tcp.abc_l_var`) → controls cwnd growth aggressiveness
  - Reassembly queue (`net.inet.tcp.reass.maxqueuelen`) → adapts to out-of-order segments
- Monitors:
  - RTT (latency)
  - Packet loss
  - Jitter
  - Throughput
  - Kernel `intr_queue_drops`
  - Out-of-order segments
- Tunes mbuf clusters and jumbo buffers based on NIC speed (1G, 10G, 40G).  
- Tunes UDP receive buffer size based on NIC speed.  
- Applies changes immediately via `sysctl` and persists them in `/etc/sysctl.conf`.  
- Configures ISR tunables (`maxthreads`, `bindthreads`, `defaultqlimit`, `maxqlimit`) via `/boot/loader.conf` (requires reboot).  
- Adds automatic comments with timestamp in `/etc/sysctl.conf` and `/boot/loader.conf` to mark lines generated by the autotuner for traceability.  
- Flexible logging:
  - Terminal only
  - Terminal + date
  - File logging

## Network Tier Classification
The script evaluates **RTT (latency)**, **packet loss**, **throughput**, and also **jitter/out-of-order** to classify the connection:

| Tier        | Conditions (examples)                                   | Behavior                        |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| very_slow   | RTT ≥ 250ms or loss ≥ 5%                                | Conservative buffers, Vegas/CHD |
| slow        | RTT ≥ 150ms or loss ≥ 2% or throughput < 2 Mbps         | Larger buffers, Vegas/HTCP      |
| medium      | RTT ≥ 80ms or throughput < 20 Mbps                      | Balanced buffers, HTCP/Cubic    |
| fast        | RTT ≥ 30ms or throughput < 200 Mbps                     | Aggressive buffers, DCTCP/HTCP  |
| very_fast   | RTT < 30ms and throughput ≥ 1 Gbps                      | Maximum buffers, BBR/RACK       |

---

## Requirements
- FreeBSD system with root privileges.
- Utilities: `sysctl`, `ping`, `netstat`.
- Reboot required for loader.conf tunables (`net.isr.*`).

---

## Notes
- The script runs in an infinite loop. Stop it with `Ctrl+C`.
- Ensure `/etc/sysctl.conf` and `/boot/loader.conf` is writable for persistence.
- Ensure that the congestion control algorithms (cubic, chd, htcp, dctcp, cdg, vegas) can load.
- Ensure that the TCP stacks (freebsd, bbr, rack) can load.
- `delayed_ack` tier setting may be overridden by jitter detection.
- `abc_l_var` and `reass.maxqueuelen` are tuned dynamically based on stability and out-of-order metrics.
